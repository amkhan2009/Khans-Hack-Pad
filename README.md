Khan Pad
The Khan is Board of typing is a 4 key macropad/keyboard with 2 EC11 style rotary encoders.

Features:
Sandwich style mount - 3D printable with screws and heatset inserts
EC11 Rotary encoders for rotational action AND they serve as switches/keys
4 fully programmable keys in a matrix
CAD Model:
4 heatset inserts and 4 M3 screws are used to keep everything together

The model consists of a bottom case, a plate, and a bracket for the top, so the key switches themselves are less exposed.
